It is not something to do only on some special occasions, but we can be kind to others every time and everywhere. Our every single act of kindness will count.Everyone has some problems in his life, and they all need sympathy or kindness of others. A small deed of kindness can help them in reducing their stress level, and also provide them with the strength to bear the pain. Kindness does not require any monetary support. Just sitting and smiling with them will have much positive impact on them.The receiver as well as the doer, both gets the benefit of kindness in their way. The receiver gets the benefit immediately, but the doer gets its advantage much later, and in an indirect way. We must be kind to people without expecting the same in return.Also, your kindness should not be objective-based, but it should be without any objective. Something that your kindness will give you instantly is immense joy, inner satisfaction, and hope. Your kindness will also motivate others to be like you.
